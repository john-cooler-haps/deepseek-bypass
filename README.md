# DeepSeek Bypass: Restoring by Open AI Responses

## 🚀 Project Overview
DeepSeek Bypass is a Chrome extension designed to **automatically detect and replace censored responses** in DeepSeek AI with content generated by **OpenAI's GPT model**. This tool ensures that users receive **unfiltered, informative, and contextually relevant responses**, overcoming the limitations imposed by AI censorship.

## 🎯 Motivation: The Challenge of AI Censorship
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for knowledge access, yet many AI models are subject to **content restrictions** based on corporate policies, regulatory requirements, or political considerations. While moderation is essential to prevent misinformation, excessive filtering can:

- **Distort information access** by removing valid historical, political, or social topics.
- **Hinder academic and independent research**, limiting discussions on controversial but important issues.
- **Create an AI knowledge divide**, where different regions or platforms provide inconsistent or biased AI responses.

DeepSeek AI, a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), frequently **filters and suppresses** responses to sensitive queries, replacing them with evasive language or refusals. This project seeks to **restore transparency and knowledge access** by intelligently replacing censored responses with AI-generated alternatives.

## 🔧 How It Works
DeepSeek Bypass operates seamlessly within the **DeepSeek AI chat interface**. The extension:

1. **Monitors API responses in real-time** – It intercepts data streams from DeepSeek AI to identify censored messages.
2. **Detects censorship patterns** – Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and predefined heuristics, it flags responses where AI refuses to provide information.
3. **Queries OpenAI’s GPT model** – When censorship is detected, the extension sends the original user query to OpenAI’s API.
4. **Replaces the blocked response** – The AI-generated content from OpenAI is injected back into the chat, **providing a more complete and unbiased answer**.

## 📦 Installation

1️⃣ **Go to OpenAI's Platform**
- Open your browser and visit: [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- If you don’t have an OpenAI account, sign up for free. If you already have one, log in.

2️⃣ **Navigate to API Keys**
- Once logged in, go to the **API Keys** section: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

3️⃣ **Generate a New API Key**
- Click the **"Create new secret key"** button.
- Copy the generated API key immediately – **you won’t be able to see it again!**

4️⃣ **Paste the Key in the Extension Settings**
- Open the Chrome extension settings.
- Find the section for OpenAI API Key.
- Paste your key and save the settings.

---

### **⚠ Important Notes**
🔹 **Keep your API key private** – do not share it with others.  
🔹 **Usage limits apply** – OpenAI may charge based on usage. Check pricing: [https://openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing)  
🔹 **You can regenerate or delete your key** anytime from the OpenAI API Keys page.

Now you’re ready to use OpenAI’s responses in the extension! 🚀
