# DeepSeek Bypass: Restoring by Open AI Responses

## 🚀 Project Overview
DeepSeek Bypass is a Chrome extension designed to **automatically detect and replace censored responses** in DeepSeek AI with content generated by **OpenAI's GPT model**. This tool ensures that users receive **unfiltered, informative, and contextually relevant responses**, overcoming the limitations imposed by AI censorship.

## 🎯 Motivation: The Challenge of AI Censorship
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for knowledge access, yet many AI models are subject to **content restrictions** based on corporate policies, regulatory requirements, or political considerations. While moderation is essential to prevent misinformation, excessive filtering can:

- **Distort information access** by removing valid historical, political, or social topics.
- **Hinder academic and independent research**, limiting discussions on controversial but important issues.
- **Create an AI knowledge divide**, where different regions or platforms provide inconsistent or biased AI responses.

DeepSeek AI, a powerful Large Language Model (LLM), frequently **filters and suppresses** responses to sensitive queries, replacing them with evasive language or refusals. This project seeks to **restore transparency and knowledge access** by intelligently replacing censored responses with AI-generated alternatives.

## 🔧 How It Works
DeepSeek Bypass operates seamlessly within the **DeepSeek AI chat interface**. The extension:

1. **Monitors API responses in real-time** – It intercepts data streams from DeepSeek AI to identify censored messages.
2. **Detects censorship patterns** – Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and predefined heuristics, it flags responses where AI refuses to provide information.
3. **Queries OpenAI’s GPT model** – When censorship is detected, the extension sends the original user query to OpenAI’s API.
4. **Replaces the blocked response** – The AI-generated content from OpenAI is injected back into the chat, **providing a more complete and unbiased answer**.

## 📦 Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/john-cooler-haps/deepseek-bypass.git
cd deepseek-bypass
```
### 2️⃣ Load the Extension in Chrome
1. Open **chrome://extensions/** in your browser.
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
3. Click **Load Unpacked** and select the `deepseek-bypass` folder.
4. The extension is now active and monitoring DeepSeek AI responses!

## 🛠 Features
✔ **Automated Detection:** Monitors and identifies censored responses in real time.
✔ **Seamless GPT Integration:** Fetches and injects AI-generated responses when censorship is detected.
✔ **Zero User Intervention:** Works in the background without requiring manual prompts.
✔ **Respectful Bypass:** Does not hack or manipulate DeepSeek AI, only enhances response availability.
✔ **Privacy-Preserving:** The extension does not collect or store user queries.

## 🔬 Technical Details
- **Manifest v3 Chrome Extension** for security and performance.
- **JavaScript-based Content Script** that intercepts and analyzes DeepSeek responses.
- **Fetch API Override & Streaming Data Processing** to capture censored messages.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API Integration** for censorship-free responses.

## ⚖ Ethical Considerations
This project is built with **scientific integrity and social responsibility**. While it bypasses censorship, it **does not promote harmful, illegal, or misleading content**. The intent is to provide users with a **fuller understanding of the information landscape** without compromising ethical AI principles.

## 📂 Branch Naming Convention

To ensure a structured and scientifically rigorous development process, this project follows a **three-tiered branch naming system**, which aligns with best practices in machine learning research, software engineering, and human-computer interaction (HCI). The naming convention is inspired by methodologies from **ACM, IEEE, and research-driven software development principles**.

### **📌 Format**
```
[domain]/[scope]/[specific-task]
```
- **`domain`** – The general category of work (`ml`, `nlp`, `hci`, `systems`, `experiment`, `theory`, `benchmarking`, etc.).
- **`scope`** – The specific subcategory (`feature`, `hypothesis`, `implementation`, `evaluation`, `optimization`, etc.).
- **`specific-task`** – A clear and concise description of the branch’s purpose (`gpt-enhancement`, `censorship-detection`, `prompt-routing`, etc.).

### **📌 Examples**
| Branch Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| `ml/feature/censorship-detection` | Implementation of an ML model to detect censorship patterns |
| `nlp/experiment/bias-mitigation` | Experimental study on reducing biases in language models |
| `hci/evaluation/user-interaction` | Analysis of UI/UX effectiveness in AI-assisted chat interfaces |
| `systems/implementation/chat-history` | Development of a persistent chat history mechanism |
| `benchmarking/performance/deepseek-latency` | Performance evaluation of DeepSeek’s response time |
| `theory/hypothesis/ai-censorship-patterns` | Theoretical research on AI censorship mechanisms |
| `experiment/gpt-vs-deepseek` | Comparative experiment between GPT and DeepSeek censorship behaviors |

### **📌 Why This Structure?**
✅ **Scientific Precision** – Inspired by research taxonomies from ACM and IEEE.  
✅ **Clear Categorization** – Easily distinguishes between theoretical, experimental, and implementation branches.  
✅ **Scalability** – Supports a wide range of research and engineering initiatives.  
✅ **Improved Collaboration** – Enables contributors to understand the purpose of each branch instantly.

This structured approach ensures that development and research remain **organized, traceable, and adaptable** to future advancements in AI and censorship detection.
