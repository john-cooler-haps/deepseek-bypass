/**
 * This function enables the injection of a JavaScript file into the currently loaded
 * web page by dynamically creating a `<script>` element and appending it to the DOM.
 *
 * Key operations performed by the `injectScript` function:
 *
 * 1. Dynamically creates a script element using `document.createElement("script")`.
 * 2. Sets the `src` attribute of the script element to the provided file path, which is
 *    resolved using `chrome.runtime.getURL()` to make it compatible with Chrome extensions.
 * 3. Appends the script element to either the `<head>` or `<html>` element of the current web page.
 *    This ensures it runs in the context of the parent page, making it suitable for injecting code
 *    that requires access to global variables or functions on the main page.
 * 4. Removes the script element from the DOM after it is executed using the `onload` handler
 *    to avoid unnecessary clutter in the DOM and minimize potential conflicts.
 *
 * Use Case:
 * This function is primarily utilized in browser extensions to inject and execute custom code
 * into web pages for purposes like altering page behavior or enabling advanced customizations.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - The file being injected must comply with the context's security policies, such as the
 *   Content Security Policy (CSP) defined by the target web page.
 * - Certain websites may restrict or block execution of injected scripts.
 *
 * @param {string} file - The relative or absolute file path of the JavaScript file to inject.
 *                         Expected to be part of the extension's packaged files.
 * @return {void} This function performs side effects and does not return a value.

/**
 * Listens for messages posted to the `window` object, specifically checking for
 * messages originating from the same window context and having a specific `type`
 * of "DEEPSEEK_CENSORSHIP". This event listener is used to handle and process
 * deep censorship-related messages in the context of the DeepSeek system.
 *
 * Key features of this functionality:
 *
 * 1. Ensures the `source` of the message is from the current `window` object and
 *    validates the expected `type` of the event before proceeding with further logic.
 *
 * 2. Logs the censored event data for tracking purposes:
 *    - Makes use of `event.data.content` to extract information related to the
 *      censorship instance detected by DeepSeek.
 *
 * 3. Uses a CSS class selector (`chatBubbleSelector`) to identify HTML elements
 *    corresponding to chat message bubbles on the current page.
 *
 * 4. Dynamically builds a structured array (`prompts`) of user-assistant message history:
 *    - Maps over the detected chat bubbles and extracts their content along with
 *      their associated messages from DOM elements.
 *
 * 5. Sends a runtime message to the Chrome extension backend with:
 *    - The detected censorship `content`.
 *    - The flattened and fully serialized chat `history` array for processing.
 *
 * 6. Handles the Chrome extension's runtime response:
 *    - If a replacement exists in the response, the content of the last detected
 *      chat bubble is updated in the DOM.
 *    - If no response or replacement is provided, a fallback log is written.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * This event listener is pivotal in detecting and responding to censorship patterns in chat applications.
 * It interacts with Chrome extension APIs to validate and optionally alter offending text content
 * to maintain compliance with certain policies or requirements.
